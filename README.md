### ðŸŽ¯ Development Principles

Throughout this project, I followed essential software engineering principles to create clean, maintainable, and efficient code:

- **SOLID Principles:** Ensuring each component and module has a single responsibility and follows a flexible architecture for long-term scalability.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Maintaining simplicity in design and code to avoid unnecessary complexity and ensure ease of understanding.
- **Clean Code:** Writing readable, organized, and consistent code to facilitate easy collaboration and future maintenance.

### âœ¨ Inspiration

I drew inspiration from **minimalist design principles** and **clean**, **user-focused interfaces**. My goal was to create an **intuitive**, **easy-to-navigate** portfolio that feels both engaging and professional. I've also incorporated best practices from leading design frameworks and other portfolios that emphasize **clarity**, **simplicity**, and **attention to detail**.
